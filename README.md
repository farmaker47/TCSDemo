# TCSDemo

This is a demo of a simple weather application. It has been created in 2 days and contains google maps to find location of the user and another screen to provide 3 day forecast for the specific location.

App uses Google Maps, Retrofit, Volley, Espresso, Custom Views(custom RecyclerView) and takes use of the [weather api](https://openweathermap.org/api). The weather api provides 3 day forecast with intervals of 3 hours. **Important** API restricts the use of the key for 60 calls a minute!
